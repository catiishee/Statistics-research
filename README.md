Statistics Research Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on statistical analysis to explore the factors influencing the well-being and happiness levels of respondents. The main objective is to identify key indicators of happiness and make predictions for respondents with unknown levels of happiness using advanced statistical methods and machine learning models.

Objectives
Analyze sociological survey data to determine factors influencing respondents' well-being and happiness levels.
Identify significant state indicators and explore the relationship between these indicators and various external factors.
Predict happiness categories for respondents with unknown levels, using micro-precision techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
Challenges Addressed
Data Insufficiency: Addressed issues of limited or poor-quality data that could distort analysis results.
Sample Representation: Ensured that the sample was representative to avoid biased conclusions.
Handling Missing Data: Developed strategies to manage missing data, especially when missing data patterns were non-random.
Methodology
Correlation Analysis: Identified significant state indicators most closely linked to overall happiness levels through graphical and statistical analysis.

Regression Models: Developed regression models to examine how various factors such as income, family size, and education level influence the state indicators.

Predictive Analysis: Used predictive models to forecast the happiness levels for respondents with unknown ratings, filling in missing values to gain a comprehensive view of overall happiness.

Logistic Models for Happiness Prediction: Applied logistic regression models to classify respondents into distinct happiness categories based on predicted levels of key state indicators.

Key Findings
Significant factors such as freedom to make life decisions, generosity index, and fear of social conflicts showed the highest correlation with overall happiness.
Factors like alcohol consumption, family size, and education level significantly impact critical state indicators, influencing respondents' perceived happiness.
Predictive accuracy achieved a micro-precision score of 0.88, confirming the validity of the models used.
Results
The findings enable better understanding of the main factors influencing well-being and happiness.
Predictive tools developed in this research allow for the estimation of happiness levels based on available data, providing valuable insights for further studies and policy-making.
Usage
The analysis and predictions are performed using R Markdown scripts included in this repository. To replicate the analysis, open the provided .Rmd file in RStudio and follow the instructions within the document to execute the code.

Future Work
Enhance data quality by incorporating more comprehensive datasets to further refine the prediction models.
Explore additional factors influencing happiness, such as mental health metrics and environmental influences.
Develop interactive dashboards to visualize and communicate findings to a broader audience.
